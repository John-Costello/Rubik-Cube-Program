/* Programmed by John Costello */

/* Amoung the list of variables at the start of the program, there is a boolean variable called 'displayNumbers' which can
be set to true to display numbers in relation to each cell. These numbers are the cell number displayed in the top left hand corner
of each cell, below this is the number of the sticker required by the cell, and below this is the cell in which this required sticker
is located. On the top right corner of each cell is the sticker that is currently in the the cell, and below this is the cell number where
the sticker is actually required to be. */

/* This program also uses a method named, 'elementOfSet', that returns a boolean value as to whether a number is an element amoung a set of numbers in an array.
This method was used very frequently in conditional statements, as the program used a lot of sets of numbers to define different regions of the Rubik's cube. */
